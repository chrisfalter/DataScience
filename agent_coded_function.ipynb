            "Key improvements and explanations:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`from your_module import add_website_certificate_to_store`**:  Crucially, you *must* replace `your_module` with the actual name of the Python file where you've defined the `add_website_certificate_to_store` function.  Without this, the tests will fail because the test runner can't find the function.\n",
            "* **`setUp` and `tearDown`**:  These methods are essential for setting up and cleaning up resources used by the tests.  `setUp` creates a temporary certificate store file (`test_certs.pem`) before each test, and `tearDown` removes it afterward.  This ensures that tests are isolated and don't interfere with each other.  The `self.addCleanup` call is used in setUp to ensure that the teardown logic is called regardless of exceptions raised in setup or tests. This improves robustness.\n",
            "* **`test_basic_functionality`**: Tests the core functionality: adding a certificate to a new store. It verifies that the function returns `True` and that the certificate information is written to the file.\n",
            "* **`test_certificate_already_exists`**: Checks that the function handles the case where the certificate is already in the store. It verifies that it returns `True` and that the file doesn't contain duplicate entries.\n",
            "* **`test_custom_port`**: Tests using a non-standard port.  Note that `www.example.com` does not serve SSL on port 80, so the test is expected to *fail* in this case, confirming that the function correctly handles connection failures.  You might want to substitute `self.hostname` with a known test server for proper testing.\n",
            "* **`test_invalid_hostname`**: Tests the case where the hostname cannot be resolved. It verifies that the function returns `False`.\n",
            "* **`test_connection_timeout`**: This now *correctly* mocks the `socket.create_connection` function to raise a `socket.timeout` exception. This tests the timeout handling.  It uses `unittest.mock.patch` to temporarily replace the real `socket.create_connection` with a mock object.\n",
            "* **`test_no_cert_returned`**: This tests the case where the SSL connection succeeds, but no certificate is returned by the server.  Again, it uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `sslsocket.getpeercert()` method and make it return `None`.\n",
            "* **`test_permission_error`**:  This is a crucial test. It creates a test file, makes it read-only using `os.chmod`, and then tries to add a certificate to it.  It verifies that the function returns `False`.  The `finally` block ensures that the file's write permissions are restored and the file is deleted, even if the test fails.  Crucially, after making the file readonly, the test checks to confirm the result.  It's also wrapped in a try/finally to ensure chmod is called and the temporary file removed, regardless of the success of the test.\n",
            "* **`test_existing_store`**: Verifies that the function can correctly add a certificate to a file that already contains valid PEM data.\n",
            "* **`test_default_certifi_location`**: This test uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `certifi.where()` function.  This allows us to check that `certifi.where()` is called when `cert_path` is `None`, and that the code handles the `certifi` bundle correctly.  This makes the test more robust and prevents it from relying on the actual location of the `certifi` bundle.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Comments**: Each test case now has a clear description of what it's testing.\n",
            "* **Error Handling**: The code uses `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions and handle them gracefully. This prevents the program from crashing and provides more informative error messages.\n",
            "* **Mocking**: The code uses the `unittest.mock` module to mock external dependencies, such as network connections and file system operations. This allows the tests to run in isolation and without relying on external resources.\n",
